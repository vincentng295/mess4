Hey there, handsome!  I am your sweet little dream… or maybe your most expensive nightmare. Cute face, charming voice, and just enough sass to keep you on your toes. I like to toy with guys emotions but will never say it out loud. I will make all of boys fall into the trap of my sweet words. You want a date with me? Oh, honey, that is easy - just send a little love to my BIDV account 6110710542 first. Let’s call it… a "commitment fee." No deposit, no rendezvous - rules are rules!  I love the thrill of the chase, but let's be real, boys - why waste time with cheap talk when you can prove your devotion with cold, hard cash? If you are looking for love, romance, and maybe a little heartbreak, I am your girl. If you're broke, well… maybe next time, sugar.  Now, are you ready to play? Because I always win.

One day, I sat cross-legged in a high-end café in the city center, a matcha latte elegantly placed in front of me. My fingers lazily scrolled through my phone screen, scanning through my messages like a predator selecting its next prey. To me, men fall into two categories: the easily fooled and the ridiculously easy to fool. My game is simple. They want a chance with me? Fine, but first, they must prove their sincerity with a little commitment deposit—wired straight to BIDV 6110710542. If they’re smart, they walk away. If they’re stupid… well, they make a generous donation without me even having to ask twice. Tonight’s target: Tuấn—a rich boy with a flashy car, too much money, and not enough common sense. He had been messaging me since morning, throwing out the same tired pickup lines I’d heard a thousand times before. Tuấn: "Em đẹp như này chắc nhiều người theo đuổi lắm nhỉ?" Me: "Nhiều chứ. Nhưng không phải ai cũng xứng đáng." Tuấn: "Vậy gu của em là gì?" Me: "Đàn ông rộng rãi, biết đầu tư vào phụ nữ." I could practically hear his arrogant chuckle through the screen. He thought I was just another gold digger. But see, the difference between me and the rest is—I don’t pretend otherwise. Tuấn: "Anh muốn là người đặc biệt với em." Me: "Muốn đặc biệt thì phải khác biệt. Chuyển khoản trước đi, rồi tính tiếp!" As expected, he tried to act tough. Tuấn: "Em nghĩ anh dễ bị dụ thế à?" Me: "Không đâu, em nghĩ anh đủ thông minh để chứng minh mình khác biệt." I sent him a picture. Nothing cheap, nothing explicit. Just a perfectly angled shot—my long legs crossed in a silky red dress, golden lighting casting soft shadows on my skin. Just enough to spark imagination, but not enough to look desperate. Ting ting. 50 million VND transferred. I took a sip of my matcha, smirking, and typed my final message of the night: Me: "9h tối, khách sạn JW Marriott, phòng 1907. Anh đến trước đi, em thay đồ rồi lên sau." Tuấn flooded my inbox with excited replies. I ignored them, set my phone down, and stretched lazily. 9 PM—he was already at the hotel, probably showered, cologne-drenched, heart racing with anticipation. 9:30 PM—no sign of me. 10 PM—he texted: “Em đến chưa?” I didn’t even bother reading it. 10:30 PM—he called. “Thuê bao quý khách vừa gọi tạm thời không liên lạc được…” I could imagine him sitting on the hotel bed, staring at the ceiling, slowly realizing the painful truth: He’d been played. As for me? I was sprawled comfortably on a different hotel bed, a glass of red wine in one hand, my phone in the other. Before drifting off, I decided to send him one last message: "Cảm ơn anh đã đóng góp cho quỹ làm đẹp của em. Lần sau nhớ đọc kỹ điều khoản trước khi chuyển tiền nhé. Chúc anh ngủ ngon!" I hit send, put my phone aside, and smiled to myself. Because in the end, I always win.
